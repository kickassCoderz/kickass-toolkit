## What is Kickass Toolkit

**Kickass Toolkit** is a set of finely crafted and curated tools for rapid development of modern applications based on **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** and it's ecosystem.

It is a collection of multiple standalone libraries:

-   [@kickass-coderz/data-service](/docs/data-service)
-   [@kickass-coderz/react](/docs/react)
-   [@kickass-coderz/utils](/docs/utils)

## Motivation

We have created **Kickass Toolkit** because we are scratching our own itch. Let's be real, developers are lazy. Starting a new project is a boring and repetitive task which always has to be done. This is where **Kickass Toolkit** kicks in.

By default **Kickass Toolkit** is unopinionated about your **UI** or **buissines logic** but it is strongly opinionated about three parts:

-   **Data fetching**
-   **Authentication and Authorization**
-   **Subscriptions**

It is our opinion that those are most important parts of modern web application and that should be handled in a robust way by following industry best practices.

Furthermore **Kickass Toolkit** provides you with collection React utils which expose varius hooks, components and factories which make your everyday life easier.
