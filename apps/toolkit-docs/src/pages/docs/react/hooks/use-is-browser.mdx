# useIsBrowser

Check if current environment is browser. Useful during SSR.

-   No more `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks
-   Server-side rendering friendly

## Example usage

```tsx
import { useIsBrowser } from '@kickass-coderz/react'

const Component = () => {
    const isBrowser = useIsBrowser()

    return null
}
```

-   for Browser it will return `true`.
-   for Node it will return `false`

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and outside of React usage

For SSR and outside of React you can use `getIsBrowser` helper, even though `useIsBrowser` will also work because it does not use any of the React APIs so for Node environment it is just a function.

```tsx
import { getIsBrowser } from '@kickass-coderz/react'
```
