# useStorageState

useStorageState is a hook which helps persist data in chosen storage API to keep state between page
reloads.

For convinience and ease of use we also export `useLocalStorageState` and `useSessionStorageState` hooks.

## Features

-   Familiar React API
-   Familiar browser API
-   Server-Side Rendering friendly
-   Full TypeScript support

## Example usage

Let's recreate `useLocalStorageState` with help of [useGlobalObject](/docs/react/use-global-object):

```tsx
import { useGlobalObject, useStorageState } from '@kickass-coderz/react'

const useLocalStorageState = (key: string, initialState: TUseStorageStateInitalState = null) => {
    return useStorageState(key, useGlobalObject().localStorage, initialState)
}
```

## useLocalStorageState

Just like React's useState but persits into browser local storage API to keep state between page reloads.

### Features

-   Familiar React API
-   Familiar browser API
-   Server-Side Rendering friendly
-   Full TypeScript support

### Example usage

```tsx
import { useLocalStorageState } from '@kickass-coderz/react'

const Component = () => {
    // this will now persist in localStorage under the key 'count'
    const [count, setCount] = useLocalStorageState('count', 0)

    return (
        <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => {
                setCount(count + 1)
            }}
        >
            Increment
        </button>
    )
}
```

### Setter function

You can also use a setter function to update the state.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useLocalStorageState('count', 0)

const onClick = () => {
    setCount(currentCount => currentCount + 1)
}
```

It is also useful when you want to memoize event handler without changing the reference
after each state update.

The example below will cause unecessary re-renders for any component that gets onClick handler through props.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useLocalStorageState('count', 0)

const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1)
}, [count]) // onClick reference will change after each state update
```

The example below will fix that keeping the onClick reference the same.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useLocalStorageState('count', 0)

const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    // we get the current state as an argument for our setter function
    setCount(currentCount => currentCount + 1)
}, []) // onClick reference will stay the same avoiding re-renders
```

## useSessionStorageState

Just like React's useState but persits into browser session storage API to keep state between page reloads.

### Features

-   Familiar React API
-   Familiar browser API
-   Server-Side Rendering friendly
-   Full TypeScript support

### Example usage

```tsx
import { useSessionStorageState } from '@kickass-coderz/react'

const Component = () => {
    // this will now persist in sessionStorage under the key 'count'
    const [count, setCount] = useSessionStorageState('count', 0)

    return (
        <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => {
                setCount(count + 1)
            }}
        >
            Increment
        </button>
    )
}
```

### Setter function

You can also use a setter function to update the state.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useSessionStorageState('count', 0)

const onClick = () => {
    setCount(currentCount => currentCount + 1)
}
```

It is also useful when you want to memoize event handler without changing the reference
after each state update.

The example below will cause unecessary re-renders for any component that gets onClick handler through props.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useSessionStorageState('count', 0)

const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1)
}, [count]) // onClick reference will change after each state update
```

The example below will fix that keeping the onClick reference the same.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useSessionStorageState('count', 0)

const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    // we get the current state as an argument for our setter function
    setCount(currentCount => currentCount + 1)
}, []) // onClick reference will stay the same avoiding re-renders
```
