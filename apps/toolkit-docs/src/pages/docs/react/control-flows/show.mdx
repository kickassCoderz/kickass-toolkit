# Show

`Show` component conditionally renders part of the view. It renders `children` when the `when` condition is truthy or `fallback` if provided.
You can think of it as ternary operator(`when ? children : fallback`) but in JSX.

## Usage

Lets how different screens based on some state:

```jsx
import { Show } from '@kickass-coderz/react'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false)

    return (
        <Show when={isActive} fallback={<div>Inactive screen</div>}>
            <div>Active screen</div>
        </Show>
    )
}
```
